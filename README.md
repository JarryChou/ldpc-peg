# Progressive Edge Growth Algorithm in Tanner Graphs

## Introduction

LDPC (Low density parity check) codes are known to be very powerful in terms of capacity-approaching performance and low-complexity iterative decoding. But the main decoding algorithms (belief propagation and sum-product algorithm) for this code family heavily depend on the lack of short cycles in their parity check matrix. In this project, Progressive Edge Growth (PEG) algorithm by Xiao-Yu Hu, Evangelos Eleftheriou and Dieter M. Arnold is implemented and simulated, which is a greedy (sub-optimum) method of constructing Tanner graphs having a large girth. The relevant paper can be found by the title "Regular and Irregular Progressive Edge-Growth Tanner Graphs" in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol. 51, No. 1, January 2005.
